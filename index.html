  <h4>PREMISE:</h4>
  <h4>The first season follows the story of Joe Goldberg, a bookstore manager in New York, who upon meeting Guinevere Beck, an aspiring writer, becomes infatuated with her. He feeds his toxic obsession using social media and other technology to track her presence and remove obstacles to their romance.</h4>
  <h4>In the second season, Joe Goldberg moves from New York to Los Angeles to escape his past and starts over with a new identity.

  <h5>Main character:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Joe Goldberg is the main character in the book series You by Caroline Kepnes, which has been adapted into a popular TV show. He is a highly intelligent, manipulative, and obsessive man with a penchant for stalking his romantic interests. At first glance, Joe seems charming and charismatic, often coming across as a sympathetic character, but as the story unfolds, his darker, more sinister traits emerge.</li>
   <li>Joe works as a bookshop manager and later as a tech entrepreneur, which gives him access to a wide range of information about the people he becomes obsessed with. His obsession with love, control, and the idealized version of a perfect relationship drives his actions, which often include stalking, manipulation, and violence.</li>
   <li>What makes Joe particularly unsettling is his ability to justify his actions, viewing himself as a victim or a protector of his “true love.” He struggles with his moral compass, and his internal monologue often reveals his attempts to rationalize his dangerous behavior. Despite the harm he causes, he often comes off as a tragic figure, battling his own demons and trying to reconcile his warped views of love with reality.</li>
